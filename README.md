# Hyperparameter-Optimization-in-Ensemble-Classifiers-for-Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis-and-Prognosis
This repository contain codes for hyperparameter optimization in SVM, DT, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression for Breast Cancer Diagnostic and Prognostic. We employ Genetic Algorithm and Grid Search Techniques to optimize these hyperparameter of machine learning models
